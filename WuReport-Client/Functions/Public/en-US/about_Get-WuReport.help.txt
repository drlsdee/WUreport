SYNOPSIS
    The function collects a report on Windows Update on the local computer and runs pending actions if necessary.
DESCRIPTION
    The function collects a report on Windows Update on the local computer. The report should include data such as:
    - WSUS URI;
    - timestamp of the last updates installation;
    - timestamp of the last detection of pending actions (such as reboots or installing updates);
    - a collections of succeeded, failed, aborted and pending Windows updates;
    - a list of interactive users;
    - et cetera.
    The function also displays the message to all interactive users, if at least one of the pending actions was detected.
    If the local computer is waiting for a reboot or for updates installation for more than a certain number of business days, the function will do the things immediately.
    All reports stored as a JSON files in the folder defined in parameters. If the folder is not defined, the default folder path is "$env:ProgramData\PSCustomData\<ModuleName>\"
EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> Get-WuReport -ServiceType MicrosoftUpdate -Path C:\reports\ -PSCustomDataFolder Data -Weekends @('Sunday', 'Saturday') -DelayMax 3 -TimeToDisplay 60 -RebootTimeout 180
    The update source will be installed on Microsoft Update.
    The folder for storing reports is "C:\reports". The parameter "PSCustomDataFolder" in that case will be ignored.
    Sunday and Saturday are days off.
    The maximum delay for pending actions is 3 business days.
    The message should be displayed to users within 60 seconds.
    The timeout before rebooting (if necessary) will be set to 180 seconds.

    Don't forget about the "second hop problem" when you run this function from a remote PowerShell session and expect data to be saved to a remote file share.
